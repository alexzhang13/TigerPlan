# TigerPlan

TigerPlan is an event scheduling app for Princeton students and campus groups that allows users to propose event times to well-defined groups of invitees, view inviteesâ€™ availability, find the time when the greatest number of people are available, and notify invitees of the finalized event time and details. 

The website is hosted on <a href=tigerplan.herokuapp.com>tigerplan.herokuapp.com</a>.
